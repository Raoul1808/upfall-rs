The game detects a level pack as being a directory in this directory with multiple levels (.umdx files).
If a directory doesn't contain any levels files, the corresponding pack will not appear in the game.
If you place your levels in this directory, the game won't be able to detect them as they do not belong in any specific pack.

The game will cycle through levels in alphabetical order. If you want your levels to be played in a certain order, prefix the file names with a number (e.g: 01, 02, 727, etc...)
